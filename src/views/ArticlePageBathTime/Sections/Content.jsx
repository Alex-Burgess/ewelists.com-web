      It can be a daunting prospect when it comes to giving your new baby a bath. They are so small and slippery and you worry if they will like it. The first thing to say is that you don’t need to bathe your baby straight away or every day for that matter. It is fine to give your baby a clean with some water and cotton wool for the first week or two, and after that they really only need a bath every few days.

      A <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neat-Nursery-Circular-Tail-Bowl/dp/B00JYD5SEM/ref=sr_1_3?crid=25VL8XPG817Z0&keywords=top+and+tail+bowl&qid=1570651001&sprefix=top+and+tail+%2Caps%2C145&sr=8-3"> top and tail bowl </a> is designed to have two separate pools of water, one to be used on the head, neck and hands and one to be used for the nappy area. You simply need some cotton wool and water to gently clean your new baby. Some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aveeno-Baby-Daily-Care-Cleansing/dp/B01IW7YMDS/"> cleansing lotion </a> can be used with cotton wool if there are areas you want to use more than just water.

      When it comes to the first bath you should start by making sure you have everything ready and close by. You can bring a changing mat, hooded towel, clothes and nappy into the bathroom so you can do everything you need in the same room. Make sure the room is nice and warm and that the water temperature is 36/37c by using a thermometer. This <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Company-Groegg-Colour-Changing-Thermometer/dp/B002B55BN8"> thermometer </a> doubles up as a room thermometer and can be used in baby’s bedroom as well.

      Babies are slippery when wet and a support of some sort frees up your hands to wash your baby. For a simple addition to your existing bath, a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angelcare-Soft-Touch-Bath-Support/dp/B00AWMV9CY/"> bath support </a> can be used to lie your little one in while they are being washed. Make sure you only fill the water to the water line. Placing a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microfibre-Little-Gubbins-Unscented-Multipack/dp/B07CL34YN2/"> flannel </a> over your baby’s tummy can help keep them nice and warm. If you don’t have a bath or if you want to use less water, a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mamas-Papas-Bambino-Support-Positions/dp/B00104WAX0/"> baby bath </a> with a built in support is a good option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your little one can sit up they can sit and play in your existing bath. A <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anlass-Cartoon-Resistant-Children-Octopus/dp/B01M0SVFIR/"> slip mat </a> is very handy here because it will help prevent them sliding when they wriggle around. If they are still a bit wobbly when they’re sitting you can use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Safety-1st-Swivel-Bath-Primary/dp/B00CMR3H0O"> bath seat </a> which will give you extra peace of mind that they will be supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BBLIKE-Windmill-Waterwheel-Swimming-Toddlers/dp/B07N1GCJJC/"> toys </a> will give your baby something to look at while they are small and something to play with as they get older.

      Babies tend to have very sensitive skin which can dry out quickly. Choosing a bath care product that is specifically designed for dry and sensitive skin can help with looking after their skin. This <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Childs-Farm-baby-unfragranced-250ml/dp/B071WJNHTC/"> Farms Child </a> range was is formulated for babies with really dry skin or eczema.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Calypso-31200029-Natural-sponges/dp/B0721K3HR5/"> natural sponge </a> or some small flannels are handy to have to gently wash your baby. You don’t need to wash baby’s hair with soap every time they have a bath either, you can simply splash over with some put water.

    <p>
      A <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-partners-safari-hooded-towel-and-mitt-white/p3382355"> hooded towel </a> will help keep your baby nice and warm when you take them out of the bath and prepare them to dress.
